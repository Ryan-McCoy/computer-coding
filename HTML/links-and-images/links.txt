Absolute URLs are URLs that tell the absolute position of a resource. These will work the same no matter where you put them. An example would be "https://google.com/" or "https://ryan-mccoy.github.io/computer-coding/". Relative URLs tell the position of a resource relative to the position of the current resource, such as "./index.html" or "../style.css".
