External CSS, or a separate stylesheet, is preffered. This is because a separate stylesheet can be included in multiple HTML documents without needing to copy it to every separate page. Internal CSS, with the <style></style> tag, is slightly worse because it would have to be copied to every page. Inline CSS is the worst because it would have to be copied to each element, which can dramatically increase load times and file size. These are all still useful, even inline CSS, if you need to apply styling to one element only and never reuse it.
