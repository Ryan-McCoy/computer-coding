        <p>
            Linux is included because it is the most popular FOSS OS, and the best OS for coding. 
            The GNU Compiler Collection is a collection of compilers for many languages, including, but not limited to, GCC, for C; G++, for C++; Objective-C; and many others.
            These compilers could be used by future civilizations to understand our programming languages, and compile Linux.
            The computer schematic would be neccessary to create a computer capable of running the other programs included.
