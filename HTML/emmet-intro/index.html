    <h1>Emmet in VSCode</h1>
    <h2>What is Emmet</h2>
    <p>
      Emmet is a built-in tool for VSCode that is used primarily when editing
      HTML. It gives easy and powerful abbreviations and shortcuts to speed up
      your workflow.
    </p>
    <h2>Basic Usage</h2>
    <p>
      The most basic use of Emmet is the abbreviations. For the rest of this
      document, using an abbreviation means typing whatever is said then hitting
      tab. When you make a new HTML file, you can use the Emmet abbreviation
      <code>!</code> to get basic boilerplate. You can also use
      <code>!!!</code> to get just the doctype declaration. To link a
      stylesheet, you can use the abbreviation <code>link:css</code>, which will
      link a stylesheet named style.css, which can be changed afterwards. There
      are many abbreviations, and generally the name of a tag can be used as an
      abbreviation.
    </p>
    <h2>Advanced Abbreviations</h2>
    <p>
      Abbreviations can be combined. If you want to have a div with a p tag
      inside, you can use <code>div>p</code>. The greater than symbol means to
      put a tag within another. For an unordered list with three elements, you
      can use <code>ul>li*3</code>. An asterisk with a number afterwards means
      to repeat the previous element multiple times. If you want an unordered
      list with three elements that each have a link and a paragraph, you can
      use <code>ul>li*3>a,p</code>. Emmet also has some more complicated
      abbreviations. For example, <code>a:blank</code> will automatically add
      the options to make it safe to link to an external site.
    </p>
    <h3>Classes and ids</h3>
    <p>
      With Emmet, placing a hashtag (#) after an element name will give it the
      id of whatever comes after the hashtag. For example,
      <code>div#main</code> will create a div with id main.
